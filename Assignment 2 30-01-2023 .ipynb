    "# Q5. Why and when to use while loop in python give a detailed description with example.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans. why - 1) In Python, a while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition is met.\n",
    "#            2)The code block will be executed repeatedly as long as the condition remains true. Once the condition becomes false, the loop will exit and the program will continue with the next line of code after the while loop.\n",
    "#     When - 1) When the number of iterations is not known in advance, If you need to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met, but you don't know exactly how many times the loop needs to run, a while loop is a good choice.\n",
    "#            2) When you want to iterate over a list or other iterable object, Although Python has built-in ways to iterate over lists and other iterable objects (such as for loops), there may be cases where you need to perform more complex logic to determine when to stop iterating. A while loop can be used to achieve this.\n",
    "#            3) When you want to create an infinite loop, In some cases, you may want a loop to run indefinitely until a specific condition is met. This is called an infinite loop, and it can be created using a while loop with a condition that is always true.\n",
